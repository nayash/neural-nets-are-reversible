# Neural Nets Are Reversible

This project is intended to validate the ideas presented in the paper 
"Deep Neural Networks are Surprisingly Reversible: A Baseline for Zero-Shot Inversion", 
where authors demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, neural nets are not
the black boxes we thought they were. 

I am working on this project to validate my understanding of the paper on simpler
problems like MNIST.
